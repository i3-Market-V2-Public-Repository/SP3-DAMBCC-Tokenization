# Treasury Smart Contract

This repository contains te smart contact that define and maintains the token strategy for the i3-market ecosystem.

![Token strategy](images/token-strategy.png)

The smart contract is based on the ERC1155 standard in order to deploy a gas-efficient token contract.   
The Treasury smart contract is used to represent multiple marketplaces tokens at once.

## Getting started

Users have to deploy an instance of the Treasury smart contract to interact with the functions defined inside it. 
The instructions of how to deploy it in a development environment is described in the section [How to build and deploy](##how-to-build-and-deploy)

In this section is assumed that al the commands are running using truffle on develop chain:

Start the chain:

Run truffle develop chain.
```shell
$ truffle develop
```

Compile and deploy the Treasury smart contract in develop network.
```shell
truffle(develop)> migrate
```

Getting addresses of the wallet. 
```shell
let accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts()
let FROM_ADDRESS = accounts[0]
```

Getting a Treasury smart contract instance.
```shell
truffle(develop)> let instance = await I3MarketTreasury.deployed()
```

Execute methods
There is two ways for executing methods:  

- **Transactions**: Change the status of the network, the are executed in an asynchronous way and only return a 
transaction id.  
  ```shell
  truffle(develop)> var result = instance.addMarketplace(FROM_ADDRESS, {'from': FROM_ADDRESS})
  ```
  result content:
  ```javascript
  { 
    tx: '0xbb1d245eb694a875c298ba9c386c114f62cca6296ed08b554fa3e19c280602c0',

      rawLogs: [] 
    },
    logs: [] 
  }
  ```
- **Calls**: They execute code that do not change the status of the network, they are free and receive the return 
value immediately.  
  Example:
  ```shell
  truffle(develop)> var marketplaceIndex = await instance.getMarketplaceIndex(FROM_ADDRESS, {'from': FROM_ADDRESS})
  truffle(develop)> marketplaceIndex.toNumber()
  ```  
  marketplaceIndex content:
  ```javascript
  1
  ```

[README](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/master/packages/contract).

The public methods exposed by the Treasury smart contact are:

| Method | Type | Parameters | Description |
|--------|------|------------|-------------|
| addMarketplace | Transaction | marketplaceAddress | Add a new marketplace to the system |
| getMarketplaceIndex | Call | marketplaceAddress | Get a Data Marketplace uint identifier            |

$ cd tokenization
```

### Installing Nodejs dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```

## Deploy in develop network
This section contains how to deploy the smart contracts in a private eht chain created by the truffle framework.

Run truffle develop chain.
```shell
$ truffle develop
```

Compile and deploy the Treasury smart contract in develop network.
```shell
truffle(develop)> migrate
```

## Testing

To test the Treasury smart contract is needed to have the 
[**_Requirements described in the Build section_**](###requirements) installed. Once that the requirements are 
installed. The Treasure smart contract can be tested using the Truffle framework. To do that, inside the project folder
init the Truffle framework.

```shell
$ truffle develop
```

Run the test command
```shell
truffle(develop)> test
```
The framework will compile, test and show the summary of testing the smart contracts.
